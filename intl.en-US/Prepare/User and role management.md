# User and role management {#concept_v1c_zzx_5db .concept}

[Project](../../../../intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Definition/Project.md) is the basic unit of multi-tenant architecture, data management, computing, and is also a subject of billing in MaxCompute. Once user becomes a project owner, all objects \(tables, instances, resources, UDFs\) in this project belongs to the user. If project owner does not grant permissions to others, no one else has permission to access this project.
